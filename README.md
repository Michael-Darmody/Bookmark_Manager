# Bookmark Manager Challenge

This challenge will focus on creating a bookmark manager for internet users who want to keep a record of the websites they visit often. The goal will be to write user stories and base the BDD, TDD, and MVC-development on them.

## User Stories ##

```
As an Internet User,
So that I can quickly visit the websites I regularly use,
I'd like to see a list of bookmarks
```
